So what’s happening? You probably added the [identity widget 103](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#add-the-netlify-identity-widget) to the `/admin/` page of your site. By default, however, the identity emails point to the root of your website. Time to do something about it! Here’s two solutions:

1. Add the identity widget to your homepage `<head>`. Upside of this method is that it’s fast and easy, no other configuration needed. The downside is that all of your users are downloading the widget while they might not need it. That’s kb’s wasted. Unless you’re using Netlify Identity for something else than the authentication of CMS users, I recommend you utilize solution #2.
